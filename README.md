<h2>Cinema Ticket Manager</h2>

<p>Cinema has been a part of the entertainment industry for a long time: a good movie is a way to escape reality and live through a variety of emotions. The best cinema experience you can get is probably in a cinema theatre. In this project, you will create an application that helps manage a cinema theatre: 
     sell tickets,
     check available seats,
     see sales statistics,
     and more.

<h2>Coffee Machine Maker</h2>

 <p>What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a  cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products:
      coffee,
      milk,
      sugar, 
      and plastic cups; 
      
if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee:
      espresso,
      cappuccino 
      and latte. 
      
Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money

<h2>Simple Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>

 <p>  Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Let’s use my program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!
