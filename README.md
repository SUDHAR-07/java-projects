Real time applications using JAVA
1. Cinema Ticket Manager 
   Cinema has been a part of the entertainment industry 
for a long time: a good movie is a way to escape reality
and live through a variety of emotions. The best cinema
experience you can get is probably in a cinema theatre. 
In this project, you will create an application that
helps manage a cinema theatre: 
     sell tickets,
     check available seats,
     see sales statistics,
     and more.
     
2.Coffee Machine Maker
  What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break?
A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough 
to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a 
cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how 
to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a 
coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical 
products:
      coffee,
      milk,
      sugar, 
      and plastic cups; 
      
if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. 
You can get three types of coffee:
      espresso,
      cappuccino 
      and latte. 
      
Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money

3. Simple Tic-Tac-Toe 
   Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game 
from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts 
and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually 
costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough
that most players discover the best strategy quickly. 
Let’s use my program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!
